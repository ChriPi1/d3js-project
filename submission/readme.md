# Submission

> This submission does not require any external tools like
npm, etc... Just open the `index.html`-file in each directory
with your browser and see the results.
For better understanding the source-code is commented.

Here is a short explanation to each code-example:

## Barchart
This example is a basic introduction to d3js.
It shows how DOM-elements are selected and how SVG-Elements
get appended.

## Data Driven Document
Based on the input-data, the document-content will change.
This example demonstrates that d3js is not only used
for charts.

## PieChart
This simple demonstration shows the d3js standard-layout pie and
the basic concept of color-mapping.

## Tree
This example is used to show one of the basic layouts the library offers. It arranges the data-nodes according to the hierachy and structures the elements to the space given in the document.

## Library Comparison
this code-sections demonstrates that you can achieve the same goal with different approaches/libraries. 
Using chartjs or other libraries can often be more straight forward,
but limits the content-creator's flexibility.
